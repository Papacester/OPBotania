Botania is my favorite mod! A huge thanks to Vazkii and his team! 

I want to make a mod adding onto Botania while sticking to the philosophy. I will also try to stick with the goals. Considering this mod name is OPBotania I dont know how to avoid grinding, but I will try my best to make it immersive and rewarding on the way!

# Botania's design philosophy:

No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;

No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;

No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;

Keep all resources as renewable as possible;

Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.

# Botania's goals:

Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;

Deliver fun and balanced gameplay without forcing players to grind;

Incentivize sandbox gameplay and allow players to create fun contraptions;

Create an overall immersive experience.

Botania (credit to Vazkii) Vazkii is the creator of Botania. Thank you very much Vazkii! This is my favorite mod. 

MythicBotany (credit to noeppinoeppi) I will most likely use alfsteel and mechanics from this mod. 
This will be a later change as I am just trying to learn to mod at the moment.

Botanical Machinery (credit to MelanX) I will later create compatibility for this mod

MysticalAgriculture (credit to BlakeBr0) I know this is a popular mod and will later create compatibility. Also gave me some ideas.

This mod is in VERY early development! 
I am also learning to code, meaning there will be more effficient ways of doing things and probably a better file structure.
Main goal is to get the mod functioning.

The goal of OPBotania is to make it a more viable option in larger mod packs that have better armor and weapons. 
The end goal is for a lot of customization on armor, tools, and weapons that use mana.

I still want to follow the basic concepts of Botania.

Some ideas I have in mind:
I like the idea from Mystical Agricultur (credit to BlakeBr0) of adding charms to weapons. I don't want to copy so I will make unique twists.

Changes to the Tiara, A toggle to turn off dashing would be nice (no recipe just base change), also giving it a buff to consume less mana (require recipe), 
being able to combine the Flugel Tiara with the Eye of the Flugel. Only one Eye of the Flugel is obtainable so I will need to make sure there is a way to 
use the abilities of the Eye of the Flugel without needing to hold the combined item.
